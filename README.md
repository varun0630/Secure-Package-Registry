  Web UI Link: https://main.d1pnln7u3cyuhe.amplifyapp.com/

### General Overview:

#### **Compute**
- **Selected**: AWS Lambda
  - **Justification**: Serverless, auto-scalable, and efficient for handling REST API calls without the need to manage backend servers.
- **Considered**: Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate

#### **Storage**
- **Selected**: Amazon DynamoDB
  - **Justification**: Scalable, low-latency NoSQL database that integrates seamlessly with Lambda for real-time data needs.
- **Considered**: Amazon RDS, Amazon S3

#### **API Management**
- **Selected**: Amazon API Gateway
  - **Justification**: Reliable for routing HTTP requests to Lambda functions; follows RESTful API patterns.
- **Considered**: Application Load Balancer (ALB)

#### **Security**
- **Selected**: AWS IAM
  - **Justification**: Provides least-privilege access, ensuring secure interactions between Lambda and DynamoDB.
- **Considered**: None

#### **Logging**
- **Selected**: Amazon CloudWatch
  - **Justification**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities for tracking performance and operational health.
- **Considered**: None

#### **Continuous Integration/Delivery**
- **Selected**: AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild
  - **Justification**: Streamlines CI/CD processes, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment for consistent development and delivery.
- **Considered**: None

#### **Auto-Scaling**
- **Selected**: AWS Lambda (Inherent Auto-Scaling)
  - **Justification**: Automatically adjusts the number of active instances based on incoming traffic, ensuring efficient handling of workloads.
- **Considered**: None

#### **Frontend Deployment**
- **Selected**: AWS Amplify
  - **Justification**: Seamlessly deploys and hosts frontend applications with CI/CD integration for rapid updates.
- **Considered**: Amazon S3 with CloudFront

#### **Backend Deployment**
- **Selected**: AWS Lambda
  - **Justification**: Serverless backend deployment reduces the need for manual infrastructure management and integrates with other AWS services like DynamoDB and API Gateway.
- **Considered**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS ECS

## Trustworthy Module Registry: Detailed Use Case


### Actors
1. **Software Developers in Company**: Engineers responsible for module integration in company projects.
2. **System Administrator**: Oversees registry operations, manages user access, and monitors security.
3. **External Collaborators**: Vendors or external developers with restricted access to specific modules.


### Goal
To provide a robust, secure, and efficient module registry tailored for a Software Company's needs, ensuring reliable module usage, streamlined vetting processes, and secure internal storage.


---


### Primary Scenario


#### 1. Module Upload and Rating
- **Trigger**: A developer creates a new npm package to share within a Company's internal projects.
- **Action**:
  - Developer uploads the zipped package to the registry.
  - The system evaluates the package using metrics like dependency pinning and review percentages.
  - A rating score is generated and displayed.
- **Outcome**: Package is successfully uploaded and rated for quality assurance.


#### 2. Dependency and Version Management
- **Trigger**: Developer queries for specific versions of a dependency.
- **Action**:
  - Search API fetches version ranges (e.g., exact, bounded, or semantic ranges).
  - Developer selects an appropriate version for project compatibility.
- **Outcome**: Selected dependency version is added to the project.


#### 3. Efficient Search and Retrieval
- **Trigger**: A team member needs a module with specific functionality.
- **Action**:
  - Executes a search query using regex over package names and READMEs.
  - Retrieves a subset of matching modules with details.
- **Outcome**: Relevant modules are located efficiently.


#### 4. Internal Module Storage
- **Trigger**: Company wants to store proprietary modules securely.
- **Action**:
  - Upload modules to private storage.
  - Restrict access to authorized employees or groups.
- **Outcome**: Proprietary modules are securely stored and accessed only by intended users.


#### 5. Package Ingestion
- **Trigger**: Developers request to add a public npm package.
- **Action**:
  - System validates the package against scoring metrics.
  - If acceptable, the package is ingested and added to the registry.
- **Outcome**: Public package is successfully integrated and accessible within the system.


#### 6. Cost and Impact Analysis
- **Trigger**: A manager requests an analysis of dependency size costs.
- **Action**:
  - System computes direct and transitive size costs.
  - Generates a cumulative report for multiple dependencies.
- **Outcome**: Decision-making on dependency use is supported by quantitative data.


---


### Extended Features


#### Security and Access Control
- The system executes a JavaScript monitoring program for validation.
- Role-based permissions regulate user actions (e.g., upload, search, download).


---


### Benefits
- **Streamlined Development**: Developers spend less time vetting modules manually.
- **Security Assurance**: Controlled access and monitoring reduce risks of malicious usage.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale queries without performance degradation.
- **Customization**: Supports both private and public modules, catering to diverse use cases.
